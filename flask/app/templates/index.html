            <h2> About this project </h2>
            <p>
                In recent years, online social media sites and social news aggregators such as Reddit have become ever more important sources of news, with people often exclusively getting information from communities which share their political views. In an effort to expose people to contrasting communities or expose biases within their own, this project endeavors to apply sentiment analysis to the comments and headlines within these specific domains in order to show political biases within these communities.
            </p>
             <p>
                 Through a more detailed lens, this project can be broadly broken into two features working towards a unified goal. The first is to provide metrics as to the ideological response to a certain article by classifying the sentiments of the community response across the multiple subreddits (communities on the popular social news platform, Reddit) within which that story has been posted, in hopes that the differences in opinions and response to the same article can inform the users as to ingrained biases across different communities. The second is to provide an average of the sentiments and reactions across the top articles within these communities at any given time, thus providing a metric of general response to increase the usefulness of the reaction to a particular article.
