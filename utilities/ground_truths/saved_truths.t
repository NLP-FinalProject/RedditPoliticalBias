I'm starting to think we live in a simulation specifically designed to be Sean Spicer's​ personal hell. 	l
Impeach him now.	l
Man that headline read like one of the bullshit ones that go to dead links, but nope it's real. 	l
>Ty Cobb, who manages the White House’s relationship with Mr. Mueller’s office, said in a statement, “We decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.”

I went to the petition website and found it being beaten by "make Antifa a terrorist organisation" and something about "#ChineseLivesMatter"

Good work guys 	l
What the actual fuck. This fucking moron. What is WRONG with his supporters!? Jesus H Christ. 

I had to listen to Rush Limbaugh the other day. I seriously wanted to puke. The blatant, proud, lack of intellectual integrity is mind boggling. 

If I ever felt the need to force another person to conform to my beliefs, which I don't, because that's fucked, I would force anyone making a claim about something to back that shit up with objective facts or at the very least, an objectively valid argument. These people are sick. 

I've kept my mouth shut for far too long. I can't fucking take it anymore. Idiots, they're idiots, and I don't care what anyone says because it breaks my heart to talk that way about my own family.

This is not all things being equal. I believe facts and evidence and even if I don't like something, if I'm presented with evidence to the contrary of my beliefs, I fucking bow out and accept reality. I don't do mental gymnastics or look for fucking loopholes in the rule book. That's the difference, those sexually repressed bacterial infections on society will argue their antiquated, debunked bullshit at the throne of their own fucking god. 	l
>In his meeting with Lavrov, **Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat.** “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” Trump said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange.

Fucking unreal.	l
Remember the "[documents in McGahn's safe](http://www.newsweek.com/russia-investigation-mystery-documents-locked-trump-attorney-safe-668199)" that had some people in the White House freaked out last year?  How much you want to bet, that one of them might be a letter signed by Trump - directing the DOJ to fire Mueller?

McGahn was given the letter to deliver, refused, threatened to resign, and then hid the note in his safe.	l
